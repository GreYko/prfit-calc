# ProofIt Premium Calculator Homework

## Prerequisites
* Java 14

## Implementation

### Dependency Injection wasn't used

So decided to make project with almost no dependencies at first iteration.


## Assumptions

##### Policy status is irrelevant for premium calculation

##### All provided amounts will have same currency
For now no currency handling was added.
